      "Like I'm Gonna Lose You" is a song by American singer-songwriter
      Meghan Trainor (pictured) from her debut major-label studio album Title (2015), featuring guest vocals from singer
      John Legend. Trainor wrote the song with Justin Weaver and Caitlyn Smith, and produced it with Chris Gelbuda. Epic
      Records released it as the album's fourth single on June 23, 2015. A soul love ballad, "Like I'm Gonna Lose You"
      is about savoring moments spent with loved ones and not taking them for granted. Critics praised Trainor's vocals
      and the song's composition, but some thought its subdued style did not suit her. It reached number one in
      Australia, New Zealand, and Poland, and number eight in the US. It was certified 4× Platinum in the US and 5×
      Platinum in and Canada. The music video depicts Trainor on a rainy night while people in diverse
      relationships interact with loved ones. Trainor performed the song on television shows and her concert tours.
